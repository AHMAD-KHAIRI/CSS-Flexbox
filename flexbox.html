    <h1>Let's Play with Flexbox</h1>
    <p>
        The flex property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container.<br>
        The flex-direction sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and
        the direction (normal or reversed). <br>
        The default MAIN-AXIS for a flex container is from left to right (flex-direction: row). <br>
        The default CROSS-AXIS is from top to bottom (flex-direction: column). <br>
        The direction can be changed in the case of row-reverse or column-reverse. <br>
        The justify-content defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along
        the MAIN-AXIS of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container. <br>
        The flex-wrap sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. <br>
        The align-items controls the alignment of items on the CROSS-AXIS. <br>
        The align-content sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's CROSS-AXIS
        or a grid's block axis. <br>
        The flex-basis defines the initial size of an element before additional space is distributed. <br>
        Flex-grow controls the amount of available space an element should take up. Accepts a unit-less number value.
        <br>
        Flex-shrink: if items are larger than the container, they shrink according to flex-shrink. <br>
